# Neovim Configuration Setup 

In this `Neovim setup`, Iâ€™ve configured various aspects to boost my productivity
and create a more efficient editing environment. From custom keybindings to a
carefully selected theme, plugins, and lsps, every element is designed to
enhance my workflow. These configurations are intended to make window
management, text editing, navigation, and development in multiple languages
smoother and more intuitive within Neovim.
